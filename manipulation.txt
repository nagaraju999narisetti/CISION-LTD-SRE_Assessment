
Suppose you have a file 'numbers.txt t'hat contains a list of integers separated by spaces:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10


You want to extract only the even numbers from the list and save them to a new file called 'even_numbers.txt'


Using "AWK" command
awk '{for (i=1; i<=NF; i++) if ($i % 2 == 0) print $i}' numbers.txt > even_numbers.txt


Using "SED" command
sed -e 's/ /\n/g' numbers.txt | sed -n '/^[02468]/p' > even_numbers.txt
